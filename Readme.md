# Milestone 3: Dynamic Resume Builder with Form (100 Points)

## Objective:
Convert the static resume into a **Dynamic Resume Builder** where users can fill out a form, and the resume is generated based on their input.

## Requirements:
* Create a form to capture user input for:
  - Personal Information (Name, Email, etc.)
  - Education
  - Work Experience
  - Skills
* Use **TypeScript** to dynamically generate the resume using the data provided through the form.

## Scoring Breakdown:

### Form Design and Validation (40 points):
- Does the form collect all necessary details in a user-friendly manner?
- Is validation implemented to ensure that all fields are filled correctly (e.g., mandatory fields)?

### Dynamic Resume Generation (40 points):
- Does the form correctly populate the resume with user input?
- Is the resume updated in real-time without refreshing the page?

### User Experience and Functionality (20 points):
